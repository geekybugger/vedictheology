                The Vedas are apourusheyam (not man-made). They are the
                universal truth. Like how the word and its meaning are
                inseparable and the meaning tries to explain the nature and
                characteristics of the word, the Vedas as the phonetic form of
                the Supreme. At the same time, the meaning of the word cannot
                explain or describe the entire nature and attributes of the word
                completely. For example, if we say an elephant, the meaning of
                elephant is known to everyone. However, the word elephant cannot
                describe the animal elephant in its entirety. In other words the
                comprehensible word cannot explain the nature of the
                incomprehensible attributes of the object. Similarly, the Vedas
                are the comprehensible from of the incomprehensible Supreme
